       "\n",
       "### Hint\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialize Your Current Directory**: Start with the current directory set to root (`current_dir = \"/\"`).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Iterate Through Changes**: Use a loop to go through each change in the `changes` list. Depending on the string you encounter, decide how to update your current directory.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Implement Navigation Logic**:\n",
       "   - **Handling `\"/\"`**: When you encounter `\"/\"`, reset your current directory to root.\n",
       "   - **Handling `\"..\"`**: If you're already at the root directory, this should not change anything. Otherwise, you need to \"move up\" one level. You can do this by splitting your current directory into parts and removing the last part.\n",
       "   - **Handling Folder Names**: If a folder name is encountered, it should be appended to the current directory, making sure to handle the formatting correctly (e.g., ensuring there's a single `/` between the folder names).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Fire Up Your String Manipulation**: Remember to manipulate your directory strings carefully. Use string operations like `split()` and `join()` to manage the current path effectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Return the Result**: Finally, ensure you return the current directory string in the correct format.\n",
       "\n",
       "By logically separating the navigation logic based on the different types of input, you'll have a clear path to the solution. \n",
       "\n",
       "Good luck, and remember to test your code with various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected!"

       "**PrepareAI:** Absolutely! Let's delve into the concept of **Process Management**, which is crucial for a role such as a Production Engineer at a company like Meta.\n",
       "\n",
       "### What is Process Management?\n",
       "\n",
       "Process Management refers to the planning, monitoring, and controlling of processes within an organization. In the context of computer systems, particularly in operating systems, it focuses on the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes. \n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Concepts in Process Management\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Process Definition**:\n",
       "   A process is a program in execution, which includes the program code, its current activity, and the resources allocated to it (like memory, files, etc.). Each process in an operating system goes through various states (like New, Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Process Life Cycle**:\n",
       "   - **New**: The process is being created.\n",
       "   - **Ready**: The process is waiting for CPU allocation.\n",
       "   - **Running**: The process is currently being executed.\n",
       "   - **Waiting**: The process is waiting for some event to occur (like I/O operations).\n",
       "   - **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Process Scheduling**:\n",
       "   This is crucial for determining which process runs at a given time. There are various scheduling algorithms:\n",
       "   - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.\n",
       "   - **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**: Selects the process with the smallest execution time.\n",
       "   - **Priority Scheduling**: Processes are scheduled based on priority.\n",
       "   - **Round Robin (RR)**: Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (quantum).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:\n",
       "   Processes often need to communicate with each other. IPC provides methods for processes to exchange data and synchronize their actions. Common IPC methods include:\n",
       "   - Pipes\n",
       "   - Message Queues\n",
       "   - Shared Memory\n",
       "   - Semaphores\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Process Control Block (PCB)**:\n",
       "   The PCB is a data structure maintained by the operating system that contains all the information about a process. This includes the process state, program counter, CPU registers, memory management information, and I/O status information.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Context Switching**:\n",
       "   This is the process whereby the CPU switches from one process to another, saving the state of the current process and loading the saved state of the next process. This is a critical feature that allows for multitasking.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why is Process Management Important for a Production Engineer?\n",
       "\n",
       "As a Production Engineer, managing processes efficiently can significantly impact system performance, reliability, and resource utilization. You should be equipped with the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Understanding of Resource Allocation**: Knowing how to allocate CPU, memory, and I/O to different processes to avoid bottlenecks.\n",
       "- **Performance Tuning**: Ability to select and configure the right scheduling algorithms based on the workload and performance requirements.\n",
       "- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Skills to monitor process behavior and detect issues such as deadlocks or inefficiencies in process communication.\n",
       "- **Scalability**: Understanding how to optimize process management to scale applications efficiently, especially in cloud environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Preparing for the Interview\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Study Real-World Scenarios**: Think about how process management principles apply to real systems, such as web servers handling multiple requests.\n",
       "2. **Hands-On Practice**: Familiarize yourself with tools and commands related to process management (like `ps`, `top`, `htop` on Linux).\n",
       "3. **Be Ready to Discuss**: Prepare to share examples from previous experiences where you optimized process management or solved related issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, understanding these concepts thoroughly will not only help you in your interview but also prepare you for contributing effectively in a production environment. Good luck with your preparations! If you need further clarification or practice questions, feel free to ask!"

       "You are tasked with implementing a simplified version of a process management system that simulates resource allocation and process scheduling. \n",
       "\n",
       "### Requirements:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Process Class**: Create a `Process` class that has the following attributes:\n",
       "   - `pid`: Integer (Process ID)\n",
       "   - `name`: String (Name of the process)\n",
       "   - `arrival_time`: Integer (Time at which the process arrives)\n",
       "   - `burst_time`: Integer (Time required by the process to complete)\n",
       "   - `priority`: Integer (Lower numbers indicate higher priority)\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Scheduler Class**: Create a `Scheduler` class that manages a list of `Process` objects. The `Scheduler` class should have the following methods:\n",
       "   - `add_process(process: Process)`: Adds a new process to the scheduler's list.\n",
       "   - `schedule_fcfs()`: Implements First-Come, First-Served scheduling. This method should return a list of processes in the order they are executed along with their start time, finish time, and turnaround time.\n",
       "   - `schedule_priority()`: Implements Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive). This method should return a list of processes in the order they are executed along with their start time, finish time, and turnaround time.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Output**: Define a function `print_schedule(schedule: List[Tuple[Process, int, int, int]])` that prints the schedule in a formatted way, showing the Process ID, start time, finish time, and turnaround time.\n",
       "\n",

       "- Processes will not arrive before time 0.\n",
       "- Handle scenarios where multiple processes arrive at the same time by scheduling them based on their PID for FCFS and priority for priority scheduling."
