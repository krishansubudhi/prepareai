       "Given a list of strings, write a function that groups the strings into lists of anagrams. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another. For example, \"listen\" and \"silent\" are anagrams.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Function Signature:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def group_anagrams(words: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Input:\n",
       "- `words`: A list of strings (1 ‚â§ len(words) ‚â§ 1000, 1 ‚â§ len(word) ‚â§ 100).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Output:\n",
       "- A list of lists, where each sublist contains strings that are anagrams of each other. The sublists can be in any order, but the strings within each sublist should maintain the input order.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "input = [\"eat\", \"tea\", \"tan\", \"ate\", \"nat\", \"bat\"]\n",
       "output = [[\"eat\", \"tea\", \"ate\"], [\"tan\", \"nat\"], [\"bat\"]]\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Notes:\n",
       "- The anagrams should be grouped together in the same sublist.\n",
       "- You can return the output in any order.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Hints:\n",
       "Think about how you can use a dictionary to map the sorted version of each word to its respective anagrams.\n",

       "**PrepareAI:** The provided answer for the 'Anagram Grouping' problem shows a reasonable approach for grouping anagrams, but it can be improved in efficiency and correctness. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the answer along with a grading and an explanation of the improvements needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Grading\n",
       "**Score: 5/10**\n",
       "\n",
       "### Strengths\n",
       "1. **Basic Functionality**: The code attempts to group anagrams correctly by comparing the sorted characters of the words.\n",
       "2. **Use of Lists**: It uses lists to store the groups of anagrams which is a suitable data structure for this problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Weaknesses\n",
       "1. **Inefficiency**: The sorting operation is called for each comparison within the nested loop, which makes this solution inefficient. The time complexity of this approach is O(n * m log m) where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word due to sorting.\n",
       "2. **Potential Redundant Comparisons**: For every word, the code compares it against the first word of every group, which can lead to unnecessary computations, especially if there are many groups.\n",
       "3. **Lack of Unique Identification for Anagrams**: For better performance, using a dictionary with a tuple of sorted characters as keys is usually preferred over multiple iterations through lists.\n",
       "4. **Possible Edge Cases**: The function does not handle an edge case where the input list is empty, although it would work as is because `anagram_groups` would just be empty.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Correct Answer\n",
       "Here‚Äôs a more efficient implementation of the `group_anagrams` function using a dictionary:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "from typing import List\n",
       "from collections import defaultdict\n",
       "\n",
       "def group_anagrams(words: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:\n",
       "    anagram_dict = defaultdict(list)\n",
       "    \n",
       "    for word in words:\n",
       "        # Using tuple of sorted characters as a key\n",
       "        sorted_word = tuple(sorted(word))\n",
       "        anagram_dict[sorted_word].append(word)\n",
       "    \n",
       "    return list(anagram_dict.values())\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation of Improvements\n",
       "1. **Efficiency**: This implementation uses a `defaultdict` to gather anagrams together based on their sorted tuple representation. This reduces the need for nested loops, yielding an average time complexity of O(n * m log m) (for sorting each word) but runs faster in practice due to reduced comparisons.\n",
       "2. **Clarity**: Using a dictionary to group anagrams clarifies the intention of the code, making it clearer and easier to read.\n",
       "3. **Handles Different Anagrams**: With each unique sorted tuple as a key, all anagrams will be grouped together seamlessly without needing to compare them directly.\n",
       "\n",
       "By using the dictionary to collect words by their sorted character tuple, this improved function groups the anagrams efficiently and clearly."

       "\n",
       "**Explanation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary difference between Merge Sort and Quick Sort lies in their methodology:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Merge Sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the data into halves recursively until each piece contains a single element. These small pieces are then merged back together in a sorted order.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Quick Sort** also employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, but it works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two groups: those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. It recursively sorts these partitions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Option B accurately captures this difference, explaining that Merge Sort divides into halves and Quick Sort uses a pivot for partitioning.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the other options:\n",
       "\n",
       "A) Incorrect - Both Merge Sort and Quick Sort can be implemented recursively.\n",
       "\n",
       "C) Incorrect - Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, while Quick Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). However, on average, Quick Sort is usually faster than Merge Sort.\n",
       "\n",
       "D) Incorrect - Quick Sort is generally faster on average due to its lower memory usage and cache efficiency, but it is not guaranteed to be faster in all cases (e.g., in terms of worst-case scenario).\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus, option **B** is indeed the best and correct answer."
