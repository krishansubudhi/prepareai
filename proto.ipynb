The use of `s.split()` is incorrect; it splits the string by whitespaces into a list, resulting in incorrect length comparisons for strings meant to be checked for unique characters.\n",

       "*Difference*:\n",
       "1. **Logic Error**: Using `s.split()` is incorrect because this splits the string into words if there are spaces, rather than individual characters. For example, \"hello world\" would be split into [\"hello\", \"world\"], which is not the intention.\n",
       "2. **Set Function**: Correctly using `set(s)` is the right approach, as it considers each character in the string but must handle each character directly rather than words.\n",
       "3. **Simplified Return**: There's no need for an additional if condition; returning the boolean expression directly is more concise and clear. \n",
