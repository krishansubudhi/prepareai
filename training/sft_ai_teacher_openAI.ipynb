Each subject emphasizes the importance of understanding both the theory and practical applications involved in the field.\\n\\nWould you like to lock this plan to track your progress?\\nStudent:  Wow, that's a pretty solid plan! I love how it covers both theory and practical stuff. Locking it in sounds like a good idea. What's next? Do I get to check off items as I go? Also, any tips to avoid getting lost in the details? I can be a bit of a wanderer when it comes to studying!\\n\\n# Plan code: \\n\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '```python\\n# Locking the learning plan for the student\\nself.tools[\\'LearningPlanManager\\'].lock_new_plan(\"Becoming Proficient in Machine Learning\")\\n\\n# Storing a memory note about the student\\'s tendency to wander while studying\\nself.tools[\\'MemoryManager\\'].update_memory(\"study_focus\", \"Student tends to wander while studying; needs tips for focus.\")\\n\\n# Responding to the student\\nself.tools[\\'Responder\\'].respond(\"Great!
