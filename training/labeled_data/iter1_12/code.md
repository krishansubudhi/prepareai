# Since I don't have a tool to fetch behavioural interview problems, I'll craft one myself based on Atlassian's values.

self.tools['Responder'].respond("Absolutely, let's practice!  \n\nHere's a question you might encounter in an Atlassian interview, keeping their emphasis on collaboration and open communication in mind: \n\n> **\"Tell me about a time when you had to work with a team member who had a very different approach to solving a problem. How did you navigate that situation?\"** \n\nTake a few moments to think about a relevant experience, then try to structure your response using the STAR method we just discussed. I'll be here to guide you and offer feedback once you're ready. ")
