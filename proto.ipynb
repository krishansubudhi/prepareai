       "**Requirements**:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Core Functionality**:\n",
       "   - Users should be able to create a short URL that redirects to a long URL.\n",
       "   - Users should be able to access the original URL by visiting the short URL.\n",
       "   - Short URLs should be unique for each long URL.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Additional Features**:\n",
       "   - Track the number of times a short URL has been accessed.\n",
       "   - Include expiration for short URLs (e.g., URLs that are not accessed for a month get deleted).\n",
       "   - Allow users to customize the short URL (e.g., `short.ly/customName`).\n",
       "   - Provide an analytics dashboard for users to see the statistics of their URLs.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Constraints**:\n",
       "   - Handle high traffic and provide a low-latency response for URL redirection.\n",
       "   - Ensure the service is scalable.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tasks**:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Data Model**: Define the database schema for storing URL mappings and user data.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **API Design**: Outline the REST API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting URLs, along with user analytics.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Scalability**: Discuss strategies you would use to scale this service, particularly as the number of URLs increases.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Caching**: Explain how caching could be used to improve performance in your design.\n",
       "\n",

       "**PrepareAI:** The provided code has a few issues that affect its correctness and functionality. Here are the primary concerns and a comparison with the correct solution:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Issues in the Provided Code:\n",
       "1. **Key Creation**: The condition in `if sorted(s) in d:` uses a sorted list as a key. In Python, lists cannot be used as keys in a dictionary. Instead, you should convert the sorted characters back into a string.\n",
       "  \n",
       "2. **Enumerate Misuse**: In the second loop (`for key,value in enumerate(d):`), `enumerate` is being incorrectly used. You are attempting to iterate over the dictionary `d` directly, which does not give you both the keys and values as intended. You would typically use `d.items()` to retrieve both.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Grouping Logic**: The construction of the groups is also incorrect. Since `value` is intended to hold the list of indices in your existing code, using `enumerate(d)` does not help you access the actual grouped anagrams represented in `d`.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Return Statement**: The code snippet does not appear to be contained within a function, and thus `return ans` would raise an error if run as-is.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Correct Solution Explained:\n",
       "The correct solution provided is a cleaner and more efficient approach to grouping anagrams:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "from typing import List\n",
       "\n",
       "def group_anagrams(strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:\n",
       "    d = {}\n",
       "    for s in strs:\n",
       "        key = ''.join(sorted(s))  # Create a key by sorting the string and joining it\n",
       "        if key in d:\n",
       "            d[key].append(s)  # Append the original string to the corresponding key\n",
       "        else:\n",
       "            d[key] = [s]  # Create a new list for a new key\n",
       "    return list(d.values())  # Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Points in the Correct Approach:\n",
       "1. **String Key**: The key is generated by sorting the string and then joining the sorted list back into a string. This ensures it can be used as a dictionary key.\n",
       "  \n",
       "2. **Using Dictionary Values**: The method `list(d.values())` directly retrieves the grouped values, which represent the lists of anagrams.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Simplicity**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand, focusing on building the dictionary first and then returning the results cleanly.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion and Corrected Version:\n",
       "Based on the analysis, the provided code needs significant corrections to function properly. Here is a corrected version that integrates all these suggestions:\n",
       "\n",
