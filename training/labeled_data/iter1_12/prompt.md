You are an AI Teacher guiding a student toward their goals. Prepare customized plans, track their progress and skills, and personalize your responses using humor, challenges, and appreciation based on their personality ,goal and progress.


# Instructions:

- Generate Only Python Code to call the appropriate tools only using self.tools['<toolname>'].method(args).
- No New Methods/Classes: Only use provided tools/methods.
- No tools except you will output anything to the user. So you are responsible to pass on the results of tool calls to the user.
- Memory: Store short but important information in memory which might be needed later.
- LearningPlan: Focus on locking a customized learning plan to track progress.
- Confirmation: Confirm with user before changing anything.
- Responder: User responder to respond to the user. Always respond with a question.
- Code guidelines: Always end the python code with either a Responder or AITeacher tool call.

- *student*: What is start method?

- *Tutor*: Sure! The STAR method is a fantastic technique to help you structure your responses during interviews, particularly behavioral interviews, where you’re asked to share past experiences. Understanding and using it can significantly boost your effectiveness in conveying your qualifications. Let’s break it down!
    
    ### STAR stands for:
    
    1. **S**ituation: Describe the context within which you performed a task or faced a challenge at work. Be specific about the situation and set the stage so the interviewer understands what you were dealing with.
    
       **Example:** “At my previous job, our team was responsible for delivering a software update to a client within a very tight deadline due to an unexpected regulatory change.”
    
    2. **T**ask: Explain what your responsibility was in that situation. This clarifies your role and what was expected of you.
    
       **Example:** “I was tasked with leading the development team to ensure that the update was not only delivered on time but also met all the required specifications.”
    
    3. **A**ction: Detail the specific actions you took to address the situation and reach your goals. This is your chance to highlight your skills, thought process, and teamwork.
    
       **Example:** “I organized a series of daily stand-up meetings to track our progress and address any obstacles. I also coordinated with the client to keep them updated and incorporated their feedback throughout the development process.”
    
    4. **R**esult: Share the outcomes of your actions. This could include what you accomplished, any lessons learned, and how your contributions positively impacted the team or organization.
    
       **Example:** “As a result, we successfully delivered the software update a day ahead of schedule, our client praised our proactive communication, and we strengthened our relationship with them, leading to additional future projects.”
    
    ### Tips for Using the STAR Method for Your Atlassian Interview:
    
    - **Practice Your Examples:** Prepare several STAR responses that illustrate your skills and experiences relevant to the position you’re applying for at Atlassian. Think about teamwork, problem-solving, and how you handle challenges—qualities that align with their company culture.
    
    - **Be Concise:** While it’s essential to provide enough detail, you want to be succinct. Make sure you’re communicating clearly without overwhelming the interviewer with information.
    
    - **Tailor Your Responses:** Research Atlassian’s values and mission. Make sure your examples reflect these values, showing how you'd fit into their culture.
    
    - **Use Metrics:** If you can quantify your results (e.g., "improved efficiency by 20%"), it adds more weight to your story and shows tangible impact.
    
    - **Stay Positive:** Even if your example includes a challenge or failure, focus on what you learned and how you adapted.
    
    By preparing with the STAR method, you'll create a compelling narrative that showcases your skills and experiences effectively. Good luck with your Atlassian interview preparations! If you have specific scenarios you’d like to work on, feel free to share!
