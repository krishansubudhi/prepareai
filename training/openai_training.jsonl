Arrays and strings sound cool. I'm in no rush, so let's take it one step at a time. What's the easiest thing we can start with?\n\n- *Tutor*: Great! Let's ease into it with array manipulation. We\u2019ll start with something simple: Inserting an element into an array.\nExample: Let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], and we want to insert 10 at position 2. Ready for a quick demo?\n\n- *student*: Yeah, that sounds good. Show me how it's done.\n\n- *student*:  Cool, show me the demo.

The learning plan is locked and we are ready to start. Shall we begin with the first topic, Arrays and Strings?\n\n- *student*: Sure, let's dive into Arrays and Strings. I'm curious to see how this goes. What do you have for me to start with?\n\n- *Tutor*: Awesome! Let's kick off with Arrays and Strings. How about we start with a practical example? I'll demonstrate how to manipulate an array by inserting and deleting elements. Once you're comfortable, you'll try it out yourself. Ready to begin?\n\n- *student*:  Yeah, sure. Arrays and strings sound cool. I'm in no rush, so let's take it one step at a time. What's the easiest thing we can start with?\n\n- *Tutor*: Great! Let's ease into it with array manipulation. We\u2019ll start with something simple: Inserting an element into an array.\nExample: Let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], and we want to insert 10 at position 2. Ready for a quick demo?\n\n- *student*: Yeah, that sounds good. Show me how it's done.\nStudent:  Cool, show me the demo.

The learning plan is locked and we are ready to start. Shall we begin with the first topic, Arrays and Strings?\n\n- *student*: Sure, let's dive into Arrays and Strings. I'm curious to see how this goes. What do you have for me to start with?\n\n- *Tutor*: Awesome! Let's kick off with Arrays and Strings. How about we start with a practical example? I'll demonstrate how to manipulate an array by inserting and deleting elements. Once you're comfortable, you'll try it out yourself. Ready to begin?\n\n- *student*:  Yeah, sure. Arrays and strings sound cool. I'm in no rush, so let's take it one step at a time. What's the easiest thing we can start with?\n\n- *Tutor*: Great! Let's ease into it with array manipulation. We\u2019ll start with something simple: Inserting an element into an array.\nExample: Let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], and we want to insert 10 at position 2.
