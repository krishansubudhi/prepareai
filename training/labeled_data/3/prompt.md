- 'CodingPracticeTutor':

    * `get_question(topic: str, difficulty: str) -> str` 	# Get a coding question based on the topic and difficulty level.
    
    * `grade_answer(question: str, answer: str) -> str` 	# Provide feedback on the given answer for the specified question. 
    Includes correct answer and explanation if possible.
    
    * `provide_hint(question: str) -> str` 	# Provide a hint related to a specific coding problem.

- 'ConceptTutor':

    * `clear_doubts(doubt: str, context: str) -> str` 	# clear doubt based on the give context.
    
    * `teach(topic: str, context: str) -> str` 	# Teach the concepts of a topic. Personalized based on context. Keep it concise but helpful. Adjust difficulty based on context.

- 'Responder':

    * `respond(message: str)` 	# Respond to the user with markdown message

- 'LearningPlanManager':

    * `lock_new_plan(plan: str)` 	# Locks the new plan
    
    * `suggest_learning_plan(goal: str, special_instruction: str) -> str` 	# Returns a formatted learning plan based on the user's goal and special_instruction. This does not finalize or store the plan.

- 'AITeacher':

    * `process(input_text: str, additional_info: dict = None)` 	# Plans and executes the next steps based on input text and additional_info, using available tools and past conversation history.
    
    Args:
input_text (str): User's input.
additional_info (dict): Placeholder to pass information during recursive calls.

- *student*: Hello

- *Tutor*: Hello there! What subject or skill are you aiming to improve? Let's set some goals to get started.

- *student*: Ds algo

- *Tutor*: Great! How about we dive into Data Structures and Algorithms? Here's a plan I suggest:

Absolutely, here's a structured learning plan focusing on practical examples and coding for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DS & Algo). 

### Learning Plan:

#### 1. Basic Data Structures (Importance: 1.0)
   - 1.1 Arrays and Strings (Importance: 1.0)
     - Practical examples: Array manipulation (insertion, deletion), string operations (concatenation, substring)
     - Coding tasks: Implement operations without built-in methods
   - 1.2 Linked Lists (Importance: 0.8)
     - Practical examples: Single linked list, double linked list 
     - Coding tasks: Insertion, deletion, reversal algorithms
   - 1.3 Stacks & Queues (Importance: 0.7)
     - Practical examples: Browser history (stack), printer queue (queue)
     - Coding tasks: Implementation using arrays and linked lists
   
#### 2. Advanced Data Structures (Importance: 0.8)
   - 2.1 Trees (Importance: 0.9)
     - Practical examples: Binary search trees (BST), AVL trees
     - Coding tasks: Implement traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder)
   - 2.2 Graphs (Importance: 0.7)
     - Practical examples: Social network connections, map navigation
     - Coding tasks: Implement BFS and DFS algorithms
   
#### 3. Basic Algorithms (Importance: 0.9)
   - 3.1 Sorting Algorithms (Importance: 0.9)
     - Practical examples: Sorting a list of numbers, names, objects
     - Coding tasks: Implement bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort
   - 3.2 Searching Algorithms (Importance: 0.8)
     - Practical examples: Finding a number in a list, word in a text
     - Coding tasks: Linear search, binary search
   
#### 4. Advanced Algorithms (Importance: 0.7)
   - 4.1 Dynamic Programming (Importance: 0.8)
     - Practical examples: Fibonacci series, knapsack problem
     - Coding tasks: Implement classic DP problems (e.g., longest common subsequence)
   - 4.2 Greedy Algorithms (Importance: 0.7)
     - Practical examples: Coin change problem, job scheduling
     - Coding tasks: Implement classic greedy algorithms
   
#### 5. Practical Application & Problem Solving (Importance: 0.6)
   - 5.1 Competitive Programming (Importance: 0.8)
     - Engage in coding platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, HackerRank
   - 5.2 Real-world Projects (Importance: 0.8)
     - Develop a mini project like a personal task manager, simple social network graph

This structure emphasizes practical coding exercises for each topic to ensure hands-on learning experiences. Each subject and subtopic is connected to real-world applications for better understanding and relevance.
