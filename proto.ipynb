       "1. The use of `@dataclass` is not appropriate in this context; Python's dataclass should be used to create classes that are data containers, and there's no necessary use of this here.\n",
       "2. The `Result` class is not instantiated correctly; the correct way to create an instance would be `Result(...)`, not just the name.\n",
       "3. The `max` function will throw an error if the input array is empty, as it cannot find a maximum value.\n",
       "4. The syntax for counting even numbers is incorrect; using a list comprehension and then calculating its length works, but the expression is not correctly formatted.\n",
       "5. The function should handle the case where the input array is empty, which is not addressed.\n",
       "6. No return statement is provided in the function for returning the results.\n",
