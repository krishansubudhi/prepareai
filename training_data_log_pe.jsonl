We’ll start with something simple: Inserting an element into an array.\nExample: Let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], and we want to insert 10 at position 2. Ready for a quick demo?\n\n- *student*: Yeah, that sounds good. Show me how it's done.\n\n- *student*:  Cool, show me the demo. I'm watching.\n\n- *Tutor*: Alright, here's a simple demo of inserting an element into an array:\n\n```python\n\n# Initial array\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# Insert 10 at position 2\narray.insert(2, 10)\n\n# Resulting array\nprint(array)\n\n```\n\n- *student*: This looks simple.\n\n- *Tutor*: Awesome! Now that you've seen the demo, how about you give it a try yourself? Here's a task: Insert the number 20 at position 3 in the array [5, 6, 7, 8].

Here's an intermediate-level coding question related to arrays and strings:\n\n---\n\n### Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n\nGiven a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n#### Example\n\n**Input:**\n```\ns = \"abcabcbb\"\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n3\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe answer is \"abc\", with the length of 3.\n\n**Input:**\n```\ns = \"bbbbb\"\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n1\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe answer is \"b\", with the length of 1.\n\n**Input:**\n```\ns = \"pwwkew\"\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n3\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe answer is \"wke\", with the length of 3.\nNote that the answer must be a substring, \"pwke\" is a subsequence and not a substring.\n\n#### Constraints\n- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`\n- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Notes\n- You can solve this using sliding window technique or hash maps.\n- Focus on optimizing the solution to handle large input sizes efficiently.\n\n\nReady to take this on? Let me know if you need any hints or have questions!\n\n- *student*: I dont know how to write it\n\n- *Tutor*: Alright! Let's first learn the sliding window technique to solve this kind of problem. Here we go: The sliding window technique slides a window of a determined size over the data to find the solution. Open to learning this technique? Or should we try another method?\n\n- *student*:  3\n```\n\nAlright, I've written the function and added some test cases. Let's see if this works. \n\nWhat do you think?

The sliding window technique ensures that we keep track of the current window of unique characters efficiently.\n\nDo you think there's any room for further optimization?

Here's an intermediate-level coding question related to arrays and strings:\n\n---\n\n### Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n\nGiven a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n#### Example\n\n**Input:**\n```\ns = \"abcabcbb\"\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n3\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe answer is \"abc\", with the length of 3.\n\n**Input:**\n```\ns = \"bbbbb\"\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n1\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe answer is \"b\", with the length of 1.\n\n**Input:**\n```\ns = \"pwwkew\"\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n3\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe answer is \"wke\", with the length of 3.\nNote that the answer must be a substring, \"pwke\" is a subsequence and not a substring.\n\n#### Constraints\n- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`\n- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Notes\n- You can solve this using sliding window technique or hash maps.\n- Focus on optimizing the solution to handle large input sizes efficiently.\n\n\nReady to take this on? Let me know if you need any hints or have questions!\n\n- *student*: I dont know how to write it\n\n- *Tutor*: Alright! Let's first learn the sliding window technique to solve this kind of problem. Here we go: The sliding window technique slides a window of a determined size over the data to find the solution. Open to learning this technique? Or should we try another method?\n\n- *student*: Ok.\n\n- *student*: There? Hello.\n\n- *Tutor*: Hey there! Glad to see you back. Let's continue with learning the sliding window technique.

It works by maintaining a window that either expands or contracts based on the conditions you need to meet. For example, in the problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters, you can expand the window to include new characters until you hit a duplicate. Then, you start moving the left side of the window up to exclude characters until the substring remains valid. This is efficient for problems with large input sizes and helps avoid nested loops.\")\n\n# After teaching the concept, let's check the progress and see if the student is ready for an actual coding challenge related to this concept.\nself.tools['LearningPlanManager'].get_progress(\"Arrays and Strings\")\nself.tools['Responder'].respond(\"I've explained the sliding window technique!

If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, evict the least recently used key.\n\nThe cache should have a fixed capacity, which is specified during the initialization.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The operations `get` and `put` should have an average time complexity of O(1).\n- The cache should be implemented using appropriate data structures.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```plaintext\nLRUCache cache = new LRUCache(2); // capacity = 2\ncache.put(1, 1);       // cache is {1=1}\ncache.put(2, 2);       // cache is {1=1, 2=2}\ncache.get(1);         // returns 1 and makes key 1 as most recent\ncache.put(3, 3);      // evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}\ncache.get(2);         // returns -1 (not found)\ncache.put(4, 4);      // evicts key 1, cache is {3=3, 4=4}\ncache.get(1);         // returns -1 (not found)\ncache.get(3);         // returns 3\ncache.get(4);         // returns 4\n```\n\n**Note:** You can use any programming language of your choice to implement this cache.\n\nGive it your best shot! \ud83e\udde0\n\n- *student*: What subjects shall I focus on? this seems to be complex problem to start with.\n\n# Plan code: \n\n", "code": "```python\n# Responding to the student\nself.tools['Responder'].respond(\n    \"Hey there!
