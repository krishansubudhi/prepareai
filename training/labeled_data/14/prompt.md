# Here is the last input from student.

Student:  Wow, that's a pretty solid plan! I love how it covers both theory and practical stuff. Locking it in sounds like a good idea. What's next? Do I get to check off items as I go? Also, any tips to avoid getting lost in the details? I can be a bit of a wanderer when it comes to studying!
