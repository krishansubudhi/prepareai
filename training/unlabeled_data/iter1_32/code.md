A) The models often lack sufficient computational resources, leading to incomplete training on diverse datasets. B) Generative AI models can inadvertently replicate biases present in the training data, resulting in the generation of inappropriate or skewed content. C) The complexity of language and human creativity poses a limitation on the model's ability to understand context and nuances in user inputs. D) Large generative AI models struggle with the integration of real-time feedback from users, leading to static content generation that does not adapt to evolving trends.")
