- 'CodingPracticeTutor':

    * `get_question(topic: str, difficulty: str) -> str` 	# Get a coding question based on the topic and difficulty level.
    
    * `grade_answer(question: str, answer: str) -> str` 	# Provide feedback on the given answer for the specified question. 
    Includes correct answer and explanation if possible.
    
    * `provide_hint(question: str) -> str` 	# Provide a hint related to a specific coding problem.

- 'ConceptTutor':

    * `clear_doubts(doubt: str, context: str) -> str` 	# clear doubt based on the give context.
    
    * `teach(topic: str, context: str) -> str` 	# Return the concepts of a topic. Personalized based on context. Keep it concise but helpful. Adjust difficulty based on context.

- 'Responder':

    * `respond(message: str)` 	# Respond to the user with markdown message

- 'LearningPlanManager':

    * `add_subject(self, subject_name: str, importance: float, parent_subject: str|None = None) -> None` 	# Adds a new subject to the plan under a specified parent subject.
    
    * `clear_existing_plan()` 	
    
    * `delete_subject(subject_name: str) -> planner_tool.PlanNode` 	# Adds a new subject to the plan under a specified parent node.
    
    * `get_plan_tree_markdown(subject_name: str = None) -> str` 	# Returns learning plan in a readable markdown format.
    
    * `get_progress(subject_name: str) -> str` 	# Retrieves concise progress information for a specific subject.
    
    * `lock_new_plan(plan: str)` 	# Locks the new plan
    
    * `suggest_learning_plan(goal: str, special_instruction: str) -> str` 	# Returns a formatted learning plan based on the user's goal and special_instruction. This does not finalize or store the plan.
    
    * `update_progress(subject_name: str, score: float, stats: dict)` 	# Updates the progress for a specific subject and propagates changes.

- 'AITeacher':

    * `process(input_text: str, additional_info: dict = None)` 	# Plans and executes the next steps based on input text and additional_info, using available tools and past conversation history.
    
    Args:
input_text (str): User's input.
additional_info (dict): Placeholder to pass information during recursive calls.

- *student*: Hello

- *Tutor*: Hello there! What's on your mind today? Are you ready to tackle some learning goals, or do you have a question to clear up? ðŸ˜Š

- *student*: yeah let's do it

- *Tutor*: What specific learning goals or subjects are you interested in? Any challenges you want to tackle?

- *student*:  im intrested in algorithms and maybe some data structures. kinda lost with them ðŸ˜…

- *Tutor*: I've locked in a customized learning plan focusing on algorithms and data structures! ðŸŽ‰ Are you ready to jump into your first lesson, or do you have any specific topics you'd like to start with?
