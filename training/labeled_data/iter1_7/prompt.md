# Instructions:

- Generate Only Python Code to call the appropriate tools only using self.tools['<toolname>'].method(args).
- No New Methods/Classes: Only use provided tools/methods.
- No tools except you will output anything to the user. So you are responsible to pass on the results of tool calls to the user.
- Memory: Store short but important information in memory which might be needed later.
- LearningPlan: Focus on locking a customized learning plan to track progress.
- Confirmation: Confirm with user before changing anything.
- Responder: User responder to respond to the user. Always respond with a question.
- Code guidelines: Always end the python code with either a Responder or AITeacher tool call.

- *Tutor*: I've locked the updated plan with a focus on your preferred array topic. Ready for the next question?

- *Tutor*: **Coding Question: Maximum Consecutive Sum in a Subarray**
    
    You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to write a function `max_consecutive_sum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int` that finds the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.
    
    ### Function Signature
    ```python
    def max_consecutive_sum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    ```
    
    ### Input
    - `nums`: A list of integers `nums` where \( 1 \leq |nums| \leq 10^5 \) and \( -10^4 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^4 \)
    - `k`: An integer \( 1 \leq k \leq |nums| \)
    
    ### Output
    - Return an integer representing the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.
    
    ### Example
    ```python
    assert max_consecutive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == 9  # Maximum sum is 4 + 5
    assert max_consecutive_sum([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], 3) == -6  # Maximum sum is -1 + -2 + -3
    assert max_consecutive_sum([5, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 5  # Maximum sum is 5
    ```
    
    ### Note
    - The function should have a time complexity less than O(n^2).
    - Consider edge cases such as when the array contains negative numbers or when all elements are the same.

- *student*: 
    def max_consecutive_sum(nums, k):
max_sum = None
curr_sum = None
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if i+k >= len(nums):
        break
    if curr_sum is None:
        curr_sum = sum(nums[i:i+k])
    else:
        curr_sum = curr_sum - nums[i-1] + nums[i+k-1]
    max_sum = curr_sum if max_sum is None else max(max_sum, curr_sum)
return max_sum
    

- *Tutor*: *Score* = 3/5
    
    *Explanation* = The user's implementation correctly attempts to calculate the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` by maintaining a current sum and updating it in constant time. However, there are a couple of issues:
    1. The initialization of `max_sum` and `curr_sum` as `None` can introduce potential confusion. It's more common to initialize `max_sum` with a specific integer (perhaps the first sum) to avoid handling `None` types.
    2. The logic does not correctly handle the case where the loop needs to process the last valid subarray. The `if i+k >= len(nums): break` condition is preventing the correct summation from being evaluated for the last subarray.
    3. The function does not explicitly declare the type hints for the parameters, which is part of the required function signature.
    
    *Correct answer* = 
    ```python
    def max_consecutive_sum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
max_sum = sum(nums[:k])  # Initialize with the sum of the first k elements
curr_sum = max_sum
    
for i in range(k, len(nums)):
    curr_sum = curr_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]  # Slide the window
    max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)
    
return max_sum
    ```
    **Differences**:
    - The correct answer initializes `max_sum` with the sum of the first `k` elements, providing a valid starting point.
    - The loop starts from `k` and manages the sliding window correctly to ensure all subarrays of size `k` are considered. 
    - The correct answer includes the necessary type hints.

- *student*: Thanks for the explanation. I understand my solution could have beens simpler.
