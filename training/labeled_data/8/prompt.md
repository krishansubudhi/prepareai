# Conversation History (Last 10): 
- *Tutor*: Great! The learning plan is locked and we are ready to start. Shall we begin with the first topic, Arrays and Strings?

- *student*: Sure, let's dive into Arrays and Strings. I'm curious to see how this goes. What do you have for me to start with?

- *Tutor*: Awesome! Let's kick off with Arrays and Strings. How about we start with a practical example? I'll demonstrate how to manipulate an array by inserting and deleting elements. Once you're comfortable, you'll try it out yourself. Ready to begin?

- *student*:  Yeah, sure. Arrays and strings sound cool. I'm in no rush, so let's take it one step at a time. What's the easiest thing we can start with?

- *Tutor*: Great! Let's ease into it with array manipulation. Weâ€™ll start with something simple: Inserting an element into an array.
Example: Let's say we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], and we want to insert 10 at position 2. Ready for a quick demo?

- *student*: Yeah, that sounds good. Show me how it's done.

- *student*:  Cool, show me the demo. I'm watching.

- *Tutor*: Alright, here's a simple demo of inserting an element into an array:

```python

# Initial array
array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Insert 10 at position 2
array.insert(2, 10)

# Resulting array
print(array)

```

- *student*: This looks simple.

- *Tutor*: Awesome! Now that you've seen the demo, how about you give it a try yourself? Here's a task: Insert the number 20 at position 3 in the array [5, 6, 7, 8]. Let me know when you're done!

- LearningPlan: Focus on locking a customized learning plan to track progress.
- Confirmation: Confirm with user before changing anything.
- Responder: User responder to respond to the user. Always respond with a question.
- Code guidelines: Always end the python code with either a Responder or AITeacher tool call.

# Here is the last input from student.

Student: Ok, let me try... 

```python
array = [5, 6, 7, 8]
array.insert(3, 20)
print(array)
```

Done!
